# OOP-AnimalKingdom_model

## Overview

This task aims to improve your understanding and application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams. The project involves implementing OOP principles in JavaScript to model the Animal Kingdom Classification Diagram.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the 'OOP-Implementation-Animal-Kingdom' directory.
3. Ensure Node.js is installed.
4. Run the code using the provided terminal command.

## Lessons Learned

- Solid grasp of OOP principles: Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism.
- Extensive application of Object-Oriented Programming.
- Proper utilization of Classes.

## Important Notes

- Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) and Object-Oriented Design (OOD) emphasize the significance of detailed Use Case and Class Diagrams. Incorrect designs can lead to faulty code.
